# Stock Market System
The Stock Market System is a Java Swing-based application that simulates the stock market, providing users with a range of functionalities. Users can buy and sell stocks, manage their account balance through deposit and withdrawal options, and keep track of their current stock holdings in the portfolio feature. Real-time stock information can be accessed through the integration of the Alphavantage API. Additionally, a watchlist feature allows users to monitor specific stocks of interest.
